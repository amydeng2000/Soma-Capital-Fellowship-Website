The original version of Soma Captial Fellowship website (now replaced by a professional webflow design)

### About Soma Capital Fellowship
In May 2020, I helped Soma Capital to launch its fellowship program, which helps aspiring students to learn from the best founders and build startups of their own. In the internship component, fellows learn how to build a company through interning at an early stage portfolio company and being mentored by their founders. During the incubation module, fellows work on their startup and pitch to Soma Capital investment committee for 20K funding. </br>

The website incorporated bootstrap as a framework, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Here're some screenshots for the website:
